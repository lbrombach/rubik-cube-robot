  Lloyd Brombach is the bottom-to-top designer of the machine and this code, as well as a 15-year stationary engineer that specializes in equipment controls. He spends his workdays repairing or designing and building controls for commercial equipment, and in his spare time studies Computer Science at Wayne State University and contributes as to the University Robotics Team as chief jack-of-all trades. His comfort with both software and hardware (sensors, actuators, motors, electrical, mechanical) makes him capable of making anything work.

This is a project to develop a robotic Rubik's Cube scrambler. Additional development may continue to include extra modes, such as timer/game modes, the ability to sync two or more of these devices together for simultaneous/competitive modes, and a cube-solving mode. The initial scrambling routine is random, but addition of official scrambling routines is in the works.


TO DO LIST:
-compile .stls for git repo and/or link to thingiverse
-insert git repo to code readme section
-add parts list and schematic
-Complete exception handling
-Optimize Mode_1 Randomizing routine to eliminate moves simply undoing previous moves
-insert library citations/license info
-learn and code official scrambling methods
-add sensors to detect cube position for jams/stepper calibration
-add camera for detection/cube mapping
